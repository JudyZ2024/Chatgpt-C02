Data centers and their associated transmission networks have become
a primary driver of global energy consumption. At present, this accounts 
for 3% of global consumption.
GPT-4, for example, required over 50 gigawatt-hours, approximately 0.02% 
of the electricity California generates in a year.
By noting now much energy each country consumes and emitts, we can
find out when the Earths atmosphre might not be able to bear the C02
emitted by GPT-4.
