My name is Judy, an upcomming freshman at Mira Costa High School. My github
account is https://github.com/JudyZ2024, and you can contact me through
qinxianzhu0608@gmail.com. 

My project is about C02 emissions from countries worldwide, and how GPT-4
can effect those emissions due to its high energy cost.
